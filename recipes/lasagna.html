    <h1>Lasagna</h1>

    <h2> Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made by layering sheets of pasta with rich sauces, cheeses, and a variety of
        fillings such as ground meat, vegetables, or seafood. Traditionally, it includes a tomato-based meat sauce
        (ragù), creamy béchamel, and generous amounts of mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. The layers are baked until the
        pasta is tender and the top is golden and bubbling, creating a comforting and hearty meal. Lasagna is often
        associated with family gatherings and celebrations due to its satisfying flavors and ability to feed a crowd.
    </p>
    <p>Though rooted in Italian cuisine, lasagna has evolved globally, with regional and personal variations becoming
        just as beloved. In the United States, for example, lasagna often features ricotta cheese in place of béchamel
        and leans heavily on Italian-American seasoning styles. Vegetarian versions use roasted vegetables or spinach
        and mushrooms, while some modern adaptations even use non-traditional ingredients like zucchini slices in place
        of pasta for a lower-carb option. No matter the version, lasagna remains a beloved staple that combines bold
        flavors with comforting textures.

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Sauté chopped onion and garlic until soft and fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add ground beef (or beef/sausage mix) and cook until browned. Drain excess fat.</li>
        <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, Italian seasoning, salt, pepper, and a pinch of sugar (optional).
            Simmer for 20–30 minutes to develop flavor. Add a splash of red wine if desired.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, mix ricotta cheese with one or two beaten eggs.</li>
        <li>Stir in some grated Parmesan, chopped parsley or spinach (optional), salt, and pepper.</li>
        <li>If using traditional noodles, boil them according to package instructions. Drain and lay flat on a clean
            surface or towel to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>If using oven-ready noodles, skip this step.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>Spread a thin layer of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Layer noodles over the sauce.</li>
        <li>Spread a layer of ricotta mixture, then sprinkle mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>Add another layer of meat sauce.</li>
        <li>Repeat layers (noodles → ricotta → mozzarella → sauce) until ingredients are used up, finishing with meat
            sauce and a generous top layer of mozzarella and Parmesan.</li>
        <li>Cover the dish with aluminum foil (optional: spray foil with cooking spray to prevent sticking).</li>
        <li>Bake for 25 minutes covered, then remove the foil and bake for an additional 20–25 minutes until the top is
            golden and bubbly.</li>
        <li>Let it rest for 10–15 minutes before slicing to allow it to set.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
